# Tetris Game
This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tetris game, written in C++.

## Features
Rotate and move tetromino pieces.
Track score and level up with increasing difficulty.
Detect and clear complete lines.
Simple text-based graphics using the Windows console.

## How to Play
Right Arrow (→): Move the piece to the right.
Left Arrow (←): Move the piece to the left.
Down Arrow (↓): Move the piece down faster.
Z: Rotate the piece.
The goal is to arrange the falling tetromino pieces to form complete lines, which will then be cleared. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the playfield.
